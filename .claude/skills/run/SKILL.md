name: run
description: Build the Zeus frontend into wwwroot, start the Vite dev server, and start the OpenhpsdrZeus backend. Kills any process already bound to the target ports first. Optional portOffset argument (e.g. `/run 10`) shifts both ports by that amount. Optional `fresh` flag (e.g. `/run fresh`) points the backend at a throw-away `zeus-prefs.db` so persisted state from a prior session doesn't leak into the dev run.

# /run — start Zeus full stack

Bring up Zeus for local development:

1. Free the target ports (kill any existing listeners).
2. Build the frontend into `Zeus.Server.Hosting/wwwroot`.
3. Start the Vite dev server (live-reload frontend).
4. Start the .NET backend (`OpenhpsdrZeus` — the only executable project).
5. Report the bound ports back to the user.

## Project layout (don't get this wrong)

The host executable and its support library have similar names — read this before editing the skill or running `dotnet run`:

- **`OpenhpsdrZeus/`** — the only executable project (`OutputType=Exe`, `net10.0`). `OpenhpsdrZeus/Program.cs` reads `ZEUS_PORT`. This is what `dotnet run --project ...` targets.
- **`Zeus.Server.Hosting/`** — a class library referenced by the host. Owns `PrefsDbPath.cs` (reads `ZEUS_PREFS_PATH`) and the `wwwroot/` directory that Vite builds into. Trying to `dotnet run` this fails with "OutputType is Library".
- Solution file is `Zeus.slnx` (no `.sln`).

## Arguments

Args can appear in any order. The skill scans each one and routes by type:

- **portOffset** (optional, non-negative integer): shifts both ports.
  - `/run` → Vite **5173**, backend **6060**
  - `/run 10` → Vite **5183**, backend **6070**
  - `/run 100` → Vite **5273**, backend **6160**
  - Reject negative values — tell the user, don't proceed.
- **`fresh`** (optional literal flag): runs the backend against a unique-per-launch throw-away `zeus-prefs.db` at `/tmp/zeus-fresh-$$.db` (`$$` = shell PID). Persisted state from a prior session does not leak into the dev run; the file is recreated empty on each `/run fresh`.
  - `/run fresh` → default ports + throw-away DB
  - `/run fresh 10` and `/run 10 fresh` are equivalent (offset 10 + throw-away DB)
  - Without this flag, the backend uses the platform default DB path (production prefs).

## Port + DB configuration (how the env vars work)

Both services already read their config from env vars — no code patching needed:

- Backend (`OpenhpsdrZeus/Program.cs`): reads `ZEUS_PORT` env var, defaults to 6060. Still uses `ListenAnyIP` so LAN access is preserved.
- Frontend (`zeus-web/vite.config.ts`): `/api` and `/ws` proxy target reads `BACKEND_PORT` env var, defaults to 6060. Vite's own listen port is set via `--port` on the CLI.
- Backend prefs DB (`Zeus.Server.Hosting/PrefsDbPath.cs`): reads `ZEUS_PREFS_PATH` env var. When set, every store (PaSettings, DspSettings, RadioState, Display, …) writes to that single file instead of the platform default. The `fresh` flag wires this to a `/tmp` path.

## Steps

### 1. Parse args (portOffset + fresh flag)

Args can appear in any order. Scan all of them: the literal `fresh` enables the throw-away DB; the first non-negative integer is the portOffset.

```bash
OFFSET=0
FRESH=0
for arg in "$@"; do
  case "$arg" in
    fresh) FRESH=1 ;;
    ''|*[!0-9]*) echo "unrecognized arg '$arg' (expected non-negative integer or 'fresh')"; exit 1 ;;
    *) OFFSET="$arg" ;;
  esac
done
FRONTEND_PORT=$((5173 + OFFSET))
BACKEND_PORT=$((6060 + OFFSET))
if [ "$FRESH" = "1" ]; then
  FRESH_DB="/tmp/zeus-fresh-$$.db"
  rm -f "$FRESH_DB"   # make sure it really starts empty
fi
```

### 2. Kill existing listeners on both target ports

```bash
lsof -ti :"$FRONTEND_PORT" | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; \
lsof -ti :"$BACKEND_PORT"  | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; \
sleep 1
```

Do NOT use `fuser` (not default on macOS).

### 3. Build the frontend into wwwroot

```bash
npm --prefix zeus-web run build
```

This runs `tsc -b && vite build` and writes to `Zeus.Server.Hosting/wwwroot/` (`emptyOutDir: true`, configured in `zeus-web/vite.config.ts`). Must complete before the backend starts so served assets aren't stale. If this fails, stop — do not start the servers.

### 4. Start the Vite dev server (background)

```bash
BACKEND_PORT=$BACKEND_PORT npm --prefix zeus-web run dev -- --port $FRONTEND_PORT --strictPort
```

- Run with `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool.
- `BACKEND_PORT` tells the Vite proxy where to forward `/api` and `/ws`.
- `--strictPort` makes Vite fail loudly rather than silently picking another port.

### 5. Start the .NET backend (background)

```bash
if [ "$FRESH" = "1" ]; then
  ZEUS_PORT=$BACKEND_PORT ZEUS_PREFS_PATH="$FRESH_DB" dotnet run --project OpenhpsdrZeus
else
  ZEUS_PORT=$BACKEND_PORT dotnet run --project OpenhpsdrZeus
fi
```

- Run with `run_in_background: true`.
- The host project is **`OpenhpsdrZeus`** (the only `OutputType=Exe` in the solution). `Zeus.Server.Hosting` is a class library — do not pass it to `dotnet run`.
- `ZEUS_PORT` is read in `OpenhpsdrZeus/Program.cs` to drive `ListenAnyIP`. No source edits required.
- `ZEUS_PREFS_PATH` (set only when `fresh` was passed) is read in `Zeus.Server.Hosting/PrefsDbPath.cs` and routes every LiteDB-backed store to the throw-away file.

### 6. Verify both ports are listening, then report

Give each server a moment, then probe:

```bash
lsof -iTCP:"$FRONTEND_PORT" -sTCP:LISTEN -P | tail -n +2
lsof -iTCP:"$BACKEND_PORT"  -sTCP:LISTEN -P | tail -n +2
```

If either port has no listener after ~10 seconds, read the background task output and report the failure honestly — don't claim success.

Final message must name the ports explicitly. When `fresh` was passed, also surface the throw-away DB path so the user knows their production prefs aren't being touched:

```
Zeus is running:
  Vite dev:  http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>   (proxies /api,/ws → :<BACKEND_PORT>)
  Backend:   http://localhost:<BACKEND_PORT>    (OpenhpsdrZeus)
  wwwroot:   built from zeus-web into Zeus.Server.Hosting/wwwroot
  prefs DB:  <FRESH_DB>   (throw-away — clean slate for this run)   # only when fresh
```

## Do NOT

- Do **not** edit `Program.cs`, `vite.config.ts`, or any other source file — the env-var plumbing is already in place.
- Do **not** run tests or a separate `dotnet build` — `dotnet run` compiles and step 3 already builds the frontend.
- Do **not** foreground either server — both must be backgrounded so control returns to the user.
- Do **not** start the backend before the frontend build completes, or `wwwroot` may be stale/empty.
