# --- Codesign-friendly payload layout (issue gh-389 / zeus-z98) ----------
#
# codesign without the deprecated --deep treats EVERY file under
# Contents/MacOS/ as a code subcomponent that must be individually signed,
# and aborts on the first non-Mach-O it walks ("code object is not signed at
# all / In subcomponent: <dll|json|…>"). A .NET self-contained publish drops
# ~360 such files there (managed .dll, .pdb, .deps.json, runtimeconfig.json,
# wwwroot/, BandPlans/, …), so the old script was forced into --deep.
#
# Files under Contents/Resources/, by contrast, are sealed as ordinary
# resources (hashed into CodeResources) and do NOT each need a signature.
# So we put the entire publish payload in Contents/Resources/app/ and leave
# Contents/MacOS/ holding only the launch.sh stub (the CFBundleExecutable).
# The bundle then signs inside-out with no --deep: we sign just the nested
# Mach-O (the apphost + the ~17 dylibs) for the hardened-runtime requirement,
# and codesign seals everything else as resources.
#
# Because the apphost still runs with its payload directory as the working
# dir (launch.sh cd's into Resources/app before exec), AppContext.BaseDirectory
# resolves to Resources/app/ and wwwroot/, BandPlans/, zetaHat.bin, calculus
# and runtimes/ all sit next to the binary exactly as the backend expects —
# no relocation, no flattening. The launcher additionally exports
# ZEUS_WEBROOT / ZEUS_BANDPLANS_DIR (honoured by ZeusHost / BandPlanStore) as
# an explicit belt-and-suspenders pin.

# off-the-cuff signed builds.
#
#   CODESIGN_IDENTITY   "Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)"
#                       (empty/unset → unsigned ad-hoc build, original
#                       behaviour, user clears xattr on first launch.)
#   KEYCHAIN_PATH       Optional path to a temp keychain (CI uses a
#                       per-run keychain). Empty → codesign uses the
#                       default keychain search list (dev-local).
#   ENTITLEMENTS_PATH   Path to the hardened-runtime entitlements plist.
#                       Defaults to installers/zeus-macos.entitlements.
#
# Inside-out signing (no --deep):
#
# Apple deprecated --deep and Apple's own guidance is to sign nested code
# from the inside out. The codesign-friendly relayout above already removed
# the subdirectories that used to force --deep (wwwroot/, BandPlans/,
# runtimes/), so Contents/MacOS/ now holds only flat Mach-O (the apphost,
# createdump, and the flattened .dylibs) plus flat resource files (~300
# managed .dll, .pdb, .json, .png, zetaHat.bin, calculus). codesign seals
# the flat resources automatically; we only have to sign the Mach-O, then
# the bundle, in dependency order:
#   1. every nested .dylib + createdump  → hardened runtime + timestamp
#   2. the apphost (OpenhpsdrZeus)        → + entitlements (the process that
#                                            hosts the mic-using webview)
#   3. the bundle itself                  → + entitlements, seals resources
# Signing inner-first matters: re-signing the outer bundle after a nested
# Mach-O changes would invalidate the outer seal, so the leaves go first.
#
# --options runtime  enables hardened runtime (required for notarization).
# --timestamp        embeds a trusted Apple timestamp so the signature
#                    stays valid after the cert expires AND because
#                    notarization rejects untimestamped signatures.

# README inside the DMG. Two flavours, picked from WILL_SIGN above:
#   - signed/notarized   → drag-to-Applications + first-run notes only.
#                          No xattr; Gatekeeper accepts the .app directly.
#   - unsigned (dryrun)  → original README with the xattr -cr workaround,
#                          which is the only way to launch an unsigned
#                          .app on modern macOS without right-click +
#                          Open Anyway acrobatics.

OpenHPSDR Zeus for macOS
========================

INSTALL
  Drag BOTH "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" and "OpenHPSDR Zeus Server.app" onto
  the Applications shortcut in this window. "OpenHPSDR Zeus Server.app"
  is a small wrapper around "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" and won't work without
  "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" installed.

  If you only want the desktop app, dragging "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" alone
  is fine.

  Then launch from Applications normally — Zeus is signed and notarized,
  so Gatekeeper lets it open without any xattr workaround.

THE TWO ICONS

  OpenHPSDR Zeus         Full native window. The radio backend runs
                         in-process inside the same window. Closing the
                         window stops Zeus completely. This is the right
                         choice for most operators.

  OpenHPSDR Zeus Server  Backend-only mode for LAN / remote / phone
                         access. Opens a small status window showing
                         the URLs to connect to from a browser, with a
                         Stop Zeus button. Connect from this Mac at
                         http://localhost:6060 or from another device
                         at http://<your-mac>:6060. HTTPS uses a
                         self-signed certificate — accept the browser
                         warning on first connect.

HEADLESS / CLI USE
  If you're running Zeus on a headless Mac (no display, e.g. a mac mini
  in a closet), use Terminal:

      "/Applications/OpenHPSDR Zeus.app/Contents/Resources/app/OpenhpsdrZeus"

  This is the no-window service mode. Identical to OpenHPSDR Zeus
  Server's backend but without the status window. Closing the Terminal
  (or Ctrl-C) stops the server.

FIRST RUN — WDSP WISDOM
  The first launch builds an FFTW "wisdom" cache and can take 1-3
  minutes. The window will load, but do NOT click Discover/Connect
  until the wisdom build settles. Subsequent launches are instant.

OpenHPSDR Zeus for macOS  (UNSIGNED DEV BUILD)
==============================================

INSTALL
  Drag BOTH "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" and "OpenHPSDR Zeus Server.app" onto
  the Applications shortcut in this window. "OpenHPSDR Zeus Server.app"
  is a small wrapper around "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" and won't work without
  "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" installed.

  If you only want the desktop app, dragging "OpenHPSDR Zeus.app" alone
  is fine.

FIRST LAUNCH (important — this is an unsigned dev build)
  This DMG is a dry-run / preview build and is NOT signed by an Apple
  Developer ID. macOS Gatekeeper will block it on first launch. To clear
  the quarantine flag, open Terminal and run:

      xattr -cr "/Applications/OpenHPSDR Zeus.app"
      xattr -cr "/Applications/OpenHPSDR Zeus Server.app"

  Then launch from Applications.

  If you still see a security warning, go to:
      System Settings -> Privacy & Security
  and click "Open Anyway".

  Tagged release and nightly builds are signed + notarized and do NOT
  need this step.
