# VST Plugin Host — Phase 2 / 3a IPC Wire Spec

Status: pinned (Phase 3a additions)
Branch: `VST-Experimental` (Zeus) / `main` (openhpsdr-zeus-plughost)
Companion ADR: `docs/proposals/vst-host.md`

This document pins the cross-process IPC contract between the Zeus .NET host
(`Zeus.PluginHost`) and the C++ sidecar (`zeus-plughost`). Both ends MUST
agree on every detail in this file; drift here will silently corrupt
audio with no runtime warning. If you change anything, bump the
`protocolVersion` field in the Hello message and update both implementations
in the same commit.

Phase 2 entry delivered the pass-through round-trip; Phase 2 real added
VST3 plugin loading + dispatch through the audio loop; Phase 3a (this
revision) adds an 8-slot serial chain with master enable, per-slot
bypass, and parameter introspection. The single-slot Phase 2 messages
(0x10..0x13) remain valid as slot-0 aliases. Native plugin GUI, TX path
wiring, browser UI, and persistence are deliberately excluded here and
land in later waves.

## 1. Naming

A unique instance suffix `{pid}-{counter}` distinguishes one host's rings,
semaphores, and control socket from any other host running on the same
machine. `pid` is the .NET host process id; `counter` is a process-local
monotonically increasing 32-bit integer that increments on every sidecar
launch.

| Resource          | Name format                                      | POSIX type             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Host->sidecar shm | `/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}-h2s`             | `shm_open`             |
| Sidecar->host shm | `/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}-s2h`             | `shm_open`             |
| Host->sidecar sem | `/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}-h2s-sem`         | `sem_open`             |
| Sidecar->host sem | `/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}-s2h-sem`         | `sem_open`             |
| Control socket    | `/tmp/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}.sock`        | AF_UNIX `SOCK_STREAM`  |

POSIX shm/sem names start with a single `/`, contain no further `/`, and stay
under 250 characters. Linux glibc maps them to `/dev/shm/<name without slash>`
and `/dev/shm/sem.<name without slash>` respectively, which is the path the
.NET side uses to attach via `MemoryMappedFile.CreateFromFile`.

## 2. Audio plane (shared memory rings)

One ring per direction. Wire layout is identical in both directions; only
the producer/consumer roles differ.

### 2.1 Sizing

```
RingControlBlock          = 64 bytes (one cache line, indices + counters)
slot count                = 8
slot bytes                = 64 (BlockHeader) + 256 frames * 1 channel * 4 = 1088 bytes
ring bytes (logical)      = 64 + 8 * 1088 = 8768 bytes
ring bytes (mmap rounded) = round_up(8768, 4096) = 12288 bytes
```

Both ends `ftruncate(fd, 12288)` and `mmap(NULL, 12288, ...)`. The host is
the creator; the sidecar opens the same name and attaches.

### 2.2 RingControlBlock (offset 0..159)

The control block is exactly 160 bytes. Both sides MUST agree on this — if
the C++ struct gets `alignas(64)` it pads up to 192 (because the natural
size is 160 and `alignas` rounds the total up to a multiple of 64) while
the C# `[StructLayout(Size = 160)]` does not, and the slots will be at
different offsets in the mapping. We caught this once in Phase 2 entry and
the symptom was "sidecar processes block, host reads slot full of zeros."
Use the explicit 8-byte alignment that comes from `std::atomic<uint64_t>`;
the head/tail fields land on 64-byte boundaries naturally because the
mapping is page-aligned.

| Offset | Size | Field          | Notes                                   |
| -----: | ---: | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
|      0 |    8 | head (u64)     | writer index, atomic, monotonic         |
|      8 |   56 | pad0           | cache-line fill                         |
|     64 |    8 | tail (u64)     | reader index, atomic, monotonic         |
|     72 |   56 | pad1           | cache-line fill                         |
|    128 |    4 | slotCount      | 8                                       |
|    132 |    4 | slotBytes      | 1088                                    |
|    136 |    4 | frames         | 256                                     |
|    140 |    4 | channels       | 1                                       |
|    144 |    4 | sampleRate     | 48000                                   |
|    148 |   12 | reserved[3]    | zero                                    |

Total prefix = 160 bytes. Slots start at offset 160.

### 2.3 Slots

8 slots * 1088 bytes each. Each slot is one `BlockHeader` (64 bytes,
defined in `audio/block_format.h`) followed by `frames * channels * 4`
bytes of planar float32. Phase 2 = 256 * 1 * 4 = 1024 payload bytes.

### 2.4 Discipline

SPSC, one writer + one reader per direction. The semaphore (Section 3) is
the synchronization edge; head/tail use Volatile reads + writes only.

- Writer:
  1. Read `head`, `tail`. If `head - tail >= slotCount`, ring is full
     (drop or wait per caller policy).
  2. Compute slot at `head & (slotCount - 1)`. Write header + payload.
  3. `Volatile.Write(head, head + 1)` (release semantics).
  4. `sem_post` on the matching wakeup semaphore.
- Reader:
  1. `sem_timedwait` on the matching wakeup semaphore (50 ms Phase 2).
  2. Read `tail`, `head`. If `head == tail`, ring is empty (timeout
     wake or spurious; loop).
  3. Compute slot at `tail & (slotCount - 1)`. Read header + payload.
  4. `Volatile.Write(tail, tail + 1)` (release semantics).

Phase 2 audio loop is single-block per `TryProcess` call; a block is
produced, the corresponding block is consumed before the call returns.

## 3. Wakeup primitive (POSIX named semaphores)

Each ring has its own named semaphore.

- `/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}-h2s-sem` — host posts when a block is
  available for the sidecar. Sidecar waits.
- `/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}-s2h-sem` — sidecar posts when a block is
  available for the host. Host waits.

C++ uses `sem_open(name, O_CREAT, 0600, 0)`, `sem_post`, `sem_timedwait`,
`sem_close`, `sem_unlink`. .NET P/Invokes the same symbols via `libc.so.6`
(Linux) or `libc.dylib` (macOS). Windows is not supported in Phase 2;
`Wakeup` throws `PlatformNotSupportedException` until Phase 3 brings a
named-Event implementation.

Initial value is 0 (creator only). Each `sem_post` raises the count by one;
`sem_timedwait` decrements by one or returns ETIMEDOUT.

The host creates both semaphores. The sidecar opens by name (no `O_CREAT`).
On host shutdown, the host calls `sem_unlink` on each name after the sidecar
has exited.

## 4. Control plane (AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM)

### 4.1 Topology

- Path: `/tmp/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}.sock`.
- Server: .NET host. Binds + listens BEFORE forking the sidecar.
- Client: sidecar. Connects after start with retry (50 ms intervals,
  total 2 s timeout).
- One concurrent connection per host. The sidecar's audio loop runs on a
  separate thread from the control read loop; both share an atomic exit
  flag.

### 4.2 Framing

Every message is:

```
+--------------------+--------+----------------------+
| length (u32 le)    | type   | payload              |
+--------------------+--------+----------------------+
| 4 bytes            | 1 byte | length - 1 bytes     |
```

`length` is the byte count of `type + payload` (i.e. `length >= 1`).
Maximum payload is 1 MiB (defensive cap; Phase 2 messages are all <100 B).

### 4.3 Phase 2 message types

| Tag | Name                   | Direction       | Payload                                |
| --: | ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
|  01 | Hello                  | sidecar -> host | u32 protoVer, u32 sampleRate, u32 framesPerBlock, u32 channels |
|  02 | HelloAck               | host -> sidecar | (none)                                 |
|  03 | Heartbeat              | bidirectional   | (none, optional in Phase 2)            |
|  04 | Goodbye                | host -> sidecar | (none)                                 |
|  05 | LogLine                | sidecar -> host | UTF-8 bytes (plain text)               |
|  10 | LoadPlugin             | host -> sidecar | u32 pathLen + UTF-8 path bytes (slot-0 alias) |
|  11 | LoadPluginResult       | sidecar -> host | u8 status, then per-status fields      |
|  12 | UnloadPlugin           | host -> sidecar | (none) (slot-0 alias)                  |
|  13 | UnloadPluginResult     | sidecar -> host | u8 status                              |
|  14 | SlotLoadPlugin         | host -> sidecar | u8 slot + u32 pathLen + UTF-8 path     |
|  15 | SlotLoadPluginResult   | sidecar -> host | u8 slot + u8 status + per-status fields |
|  16 | SlotUnloadPlugin       | host -> sidecar | u8 slot                                |
|  17 | SlotUnloadPluginResult | sidecar -> host | u8 slot + u8 status                    |
|  18 | SlotSetBypass          | host -> sidecar | u8 slot + u8 bypass                    |
|  19 | SlotSetBypassResult    | sidecar -> host | u8 slot + u8 status                    |
|  1A | SetChainEnabled        | host -> sidecar | u8 enabled                             |
|  1B | SetChainEnabledResult  | sidecar -> host | u8 status                              |
|  20 | SlotListParams         | host -> sidecar | u8 slot                                |
|  21 | SlotParamListResult    | sidecar -> host | u8 slot + u8 status [+ paramCount + params on status==0] |
|  22 | SlotSetParam           | host -> sidecar | u8 slot + u32 paramId + f64 normalized |
|  23 | SlotSetParamResult     | sidecar -> host | u8 slot + u32 paramId + u8 status + f64 actual |

All multi-byte integers are little-endian. UTF-8 strings everywhere.

`Hello` payload (16 bytes):

```
[protocolVersion u32=1][sampleRate u32=48000][framesPerBlock u32=256][channels u32=1]
```

The sidecar sends `Hello` immediately after connecting. The host validates,
sends `HelloAck`, and the sidecar then enters its audio loop. If the host
rejects (e.g. version mismatch), it closes the socket and the sidecar exits.

`LoadPlugin` payload:

```
[pathLength u32 LE][UTF-8 path bytes]
```

Path is an absolute filesystem path to the VST3 bundle directory or single
file. The sidecar resolves the path, walks the factory's class infos, and
instantiates the first class with category `"Audio Module Class"`
(`kVstAudioEffectClass`). A successful load replaces any previously-loaded
plugin atomically (the audio thread sees the new pointer via atomic
acquire-load).

`LoadPluginResult` payload:

```
status u8
  status == 0 (ok):
    [nameLen u32 LE][UTF-8 name][vendorLen u32 LE][UTF-8 vendor][versionLen u32 LE][UTF-8 version]
  status != 0 (error):
    [errLen u32 LE][UTF-8 error message]
```

Status codes:

| Status | Meaning                                                |
| -----: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|      0 | ok                                                     |
|      1 | file-not-found                                         |
|      2 | not-a-vst3 (Module::create rejected the bundle)        |
|      3 | no-audio-effect-class (factory has no `kVstAudioEffectClass`) |
|      4 | activate-failed (initialize / setActive / setProcessing tresult != ok) |
|      5 | other / unspecified                                    |

`UnloadPlugin` is empty payload.

`UnloadPluginResult` payload is a single status byte:

| Status | Meaning                                                |
| -----: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|      0 | ok                                                     |
|      1 | no-plugin-loaded (the unload was a no-op)              |
|      5 | other / unspecified                                    |

Plugin chains, parameter automation, GUI, and presets are reserved for
Phase 3+ and intentionally absent here.

### 4.4 Phase 3a additions: chain, bypass, parameter introspection

The single-slot messages 0x10..0x13 remain valid; they are slot-0 aliases
of the new 0x14..0x17 family. The .NET `LoadPluginAsync(path)` /
`UnloadPluginAsync()` API still works and now internally targets slot 0.

#### `SlotLoadPlugin` (0x14, host -> sidecar)

Payload:

```
[slotIdx u8][pathLen u32 LE][UTF-8 path bytes]
```

`slotIdx` is in the range `[0, kMaxSlots-1]` (8 in Phase 3a). Out-of-range
values yield status 6 in the reply. Reload semantics match 0x10: an
existing plugin in the slot is unloaded before the new one becomes
visible to the audio thread.

#### `SlotLoadPluginResult` (0x15, sidecar -> host)

Payload:

```
[slotIdx u8][status u8]
  status == 0:
    [nameLen u32 LE][UTF-8 name][vendorLen u32 LE][UTF-8 vendor][versionLen u32 LE][UTF-8 version]
  status != 0:
    [errLen u32 LE][UTF-8 error message]
```

Status codes:

| Status | Meaning                                                        |
| -----: | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      0 | ok                                                             |
|      1 | file-not-found                                                 |
|      2 | not-a-vst3                                                     |
|      3 | no-audio-effect-class                                          |
|      4 | activate-failed                                                |
|      5 | other                                                          |
|      6 | invalid-slot-index                                             |

#### `SlotUnloadPlugin` (0x16, host -> sidecar)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8]`.

#### `SlotUnloadPluginResult` (0x17, sidecar -> host)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8][status u8]`. Statuses: 0 ok, 1 no-plugin-loaded,
5 other, 6 invalid-slot-index.

#### `SlotSetBypass` (0x18, host -> sidecar)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8][bypass u8]` (0=run, 1=bypass). Bypassed slots are
skipped on the audio thread; the running buffer simply moves to the next
slot. Reply: `0x19 SlotSetBypassResult` `[slotIdx u8][status u8]`.

#### `SetChainEnabled` (0x1A, host -> sidecar)

Payload: `[enabled u8]` (0=master off, 1=master on). When master is off
the audio thread does a single memcpy from input to output regardless of
slot population — bit-identical pass-through. Reply: `0x1B
SetChainEnabledResult` `[status u8]`.

#### `SlotListParams` (0x20, host -> sidecar)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8]`. The sidecar walks the plugin's IEditController.

#### `SlotParamListResult` (0x21, sidecar -> host)

Payload:

```
[slotIdx u8][status u8]
  status == 0:
    [paramCount u32 LE]
    repeat paramCount times:
      [paramId u32 LE]
      [nameLen u32 LE][UTF-8 name]
      [unitsLen u32 LE][UTF-8 units]
      [defaultValue f64 LE]   (normalized 0..1)
      [currentValue f64 LE]   (normalized 0..1)
      [stepCount i32 LE]      (0 = continuous, >0 = stepped/list)
      [flags u8]
        bit0 = isReadOnly
        bit1 = isAutomatable
        bit2 = isHidden
        bit3 = isList (enum-style)
```

Statuses: 0 ok, 1 no-plugin-loaded, 5 other, 6 invalid-slot-index,
7 controller-unavailable.

#### `SlotSetParam` (0x22, host -> sidecar)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8][paramId u32 LE][normalized f64 LE]`. The sidecar
clamps `normalized` to `[0,1]` before calling
`IEditController::setParamNormalized`.

#### `SlotSetParamResult` (0x23, sidecar -> host)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8][paramId u32 LE][status u8][actualValue f64 LE]`.
`actualValue` is what the plugin reports back via
`getParamNormalized` after the set (some plugins quantise / clamp). On a
non-zero status, `actualValue` is unspecified (typically NaN).

Statuses: 0 ok, 1 no-plugin-loaded, 5 other, 6 invalid-slot-index,
7 controller-unavailable.

### 4.5 Phase 3 GUI: native plugin editor window (Linux X11)

The 0x30 family lets the host open the plugin's native editor as a
top-level X11 window in the sidecar process. Wave 6+ extends the same
shape to Windows (HWND) and macOS (NSView) once the operator moves to
those platforms; the wire format below is platform-agnostic and stays
unchanged when the cross-platform code lands.

The sidecar runs ONE dedicated GUI thread per process (lazy init on
first `SlotShowEditor`). The audio thread is unchanged — it never calls
X11, never blocks on the GUI thread, never holds GUI-related locks.
Control-thread requests post work to the GUI thread via a thread-safe
queue and synchronously wait up to 1 s for a reply before forwarding
the result frame back to the host.

#### `SlotShowEditor` (0x30, host -> sidecar)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8]`. Idempotent — calling while an editor is
already open for the slot is a no-op that returns the current width /
height.

#### `SlotShowEditorResult` (0x31, sidecar -> host, sync reply to 0x30)

Payload:

```
[slotIdx u8][status u8]
  status == 0:
    [width u32 LE][height u32 LE]
```

Status codes:

| Status | Meaning                                                 |
| -----: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|      0 | ok                                                      |
|      1 | no-plugin-loaded                                        |
|      2 | plugin-has-no-editor (controller->createView returned null) |
|      3 | platform-not-supported (view doesn't accept X11EmbedWindowID) |
|      4 | attach-failed (view->attached returned non-OK)         |
|      5 | other                                                   |
|      6 | invalid-slot-index                                      |
|      7 | gui-thread-init-failed (display open failed, etc.)     |

#### `SlotHideEditor` (0x32, host -> sidecar)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8]`.

#### `SlotHideEditorResult` (0x33, sidecar -> host, sync reply to 0x32)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8][status u8]`. Status codes:

| Status | Meaning                                                 |
| -----: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|      0 | ok                                                      |
|      1 | no-editor-open (the hide was a no-op)                  |
|      5 | other                                                   |
|      6 | invalid-slot-index                                      |

#### `EditorClosed` (0x34, sidecar -> host, ASYNC event)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8]`. Fired when the window-manager close button
fires (ClientMessage / WM_DELETE_WINDOW) OR the plugin asks to close.
This is NOT a reply to any request — it arrives unsolicited and the
host's control-channel reader must dispatch it to an event handler,
not to a pending awaiter.

#### `EditorResized` (0x35, sidecar -> host, ASYNC event)

Payload: `[slotIdx u8][width u32 LE][height u32 LE]`. Fired when the
plugin's `IPlugFrame::resizeView` succeeds and the X11 window has been
resized. Informational — the host doesn't need to acknowledge.

### 4.6 Threading note for parameter changes

VST3 strictly recommends that parameter changes flow through
`IParameterChanges` on the audio thread inside `ProcessData`. Phase 3a
deliberately bypasses that and calls `IEditController::setParamNormalized`
directly from the control thread. This matches what most simple hosts do
for non-realtime parameter tweaks; the controller object is required by
the VST3 spec to be reentrant relative to the audio-thread `IComponent`.
A future phase that adds parameter automation lanes will need to revisit
this.

## 5. Lifecycle

### 5.1 Startup

1. Host computes `{pid}-{counter}`.
2. Host binds the AF_UNIX socket and starts an `accept()` listener.
3. Host creates both shm regions via `shm_open` + `ftruncate(12288)` + `mmap`.
4. Host creates both named semaphores via `sem_open(O_CREAT)` with initial 0.
5. Host launches the sidecar with argv:
   - `--shm-name {pid}-{counter}` (the suffix; sidecar appends `-h2s`/`-s2h`)
   - `--control-pipe /tmp/zeus-plughost-{pid}-{counter}.sock`
6. Sidecar connects to the control socket (retry, 2 s timeout).
7. Sidecar opens both shm regions by name + maps them.
8. Sidecar opens both named semaphores by name.
9. Sidecar sends `Hello`. Host validates and sends `HelloAck`. Host
   considers the plugin host running.
10. Sidecar enters audio loop.

### 5.2 Audio loop (sidecar)

```
while (!stop):
    if not sem_timedwait(h2s-sem, 50 ms): continue   # poll stop flag
    in = h2s.Read()
    out = s2h.Acquire()
    copy header + payload (Phase 2 = bit-identical pass-through)
    s2h.Publish(out)
    h2s.Release(in)
    sem_post(s2h-sem)
```

### 5.3 TryProcess (host)

```
acquire = h2s.Acquire()
if !acquire: return false           # ring full (sidecar fell behind)
write header + payload
h2s.Publish()
sem_post(h2s-sem)
if !sem_timedwait(s2h-sem, 50 ms): return false   # sidecar dead or stuck
read = s2h.Read()
copy payload to output
s2h.Release()
return true
```

### 5.4 Shutdown

- Graceful (host-driven): host sends `Goodbye`, waits 500 ms for the
  sidecar to close the socket cleanly. If still alive, host kills it.
- Crash (sidecar SIGKILL or uncaught throw): host's next
  `sem_timedwait(s2h-sem)` returns ETIMEDOUT. Host detects the dead
  process via the `Process.Exited` event and flips `IsRunning = false`.
- Crash (host crash): kernel cleans up the host's process resources;
  the sidecar's next `sem_timedwait(h2s-sem)` times out, then its
  control-socket read returns 0 (EOF), and the sidecar exits cleanly.

### 5.5 Cleanup

The host is the sole owner of the names. After the sidecar exits (any
path), the host calls:

- `shm_unlink` on both shm names
- `sem_unlink` on both sem names
- `unlink` on the AF_UNIX socket path

The sidecar never unlinks. If the host crashes without unlinking, the
operator is expected to clean stale entries from `/dev/shm` and
`/dev/shm/sem.*` and `/tmp/`. Phase 2 tests assert zero leakage on every
run.

## 6. Phase 2 simplifications (called out so Phase 3 doesn't repeat them)

- Synchronous I/O on the control socket. Phase 3 will likely move to
  async with cancellation tokens.
- 50 ms semaphore timeout. Phase 3 needs ~5 ms to keep up with real TX
  audio at 48 kHz / 256 frames per block (~5.3 ms per block).
- Allocation in `TryProcess` is acceptable. Phase 3 must move to
  preallocated buffers to satisfy the realtime contract.
- Hardcoded geometry: 256 frames, 1 channel, 48000 Hz, 1 plugin slot.
  Phase 3 negotiates these via Hello.
- Heartbeat is optional. Phase 3 enforces 1 Hz with a deadman timer for
  the silent-sidecar case (sidecar deadlocked but not exited).
- No realtime scheduling priority. Phase 4 will pin the audio thread.
- VST3 only — CLAP / VST2 are deferred to Phase 4 and Phase 5.
- Single-slot plugin: one loaded plugin per host. Phase 3a (the
  current revision of this doc) raises the cap to 8 serial slots with
  master enable + per-slot bypass + parameter introspection. Reorder
  UI and persisted state come in a later wave.
- No GUI. The plugin's parameter values are accessible only via the
  sidecar's HostApplication helper; no editor window is opened.
- No parameter automation, no preset save/restore. Phase 3 brings these
  in once the chain UX shape is decided.

## 7. Error handling matrix (Phase 2)

| Condition                          | Sidecar response       | Host response                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Socket connect fails               | exit(2)                | timeout in StartAsync, throw        |
| Hello/HelloAck mismatch            | exit(3)                | close socket, throw                 |
| h2s ring full (writer)             | n/a                    | TryProcess returns false            |
| s2h ring empty after timeout       | n/a                    | TryProcess returns false            |
| Sidecar crashes mid-loop           | (kernel cleans fds)    | Exited event fires, IsRunning=false |
| Goodbye received                   | drain + exit(0)        | Process.Exited fires                |
| Control socket EOF unexpectedly    | exit(0) cleanly        | Exited event fires                  |

## 8. Cross-platform shape

Phase 2 ships Linux only. macOS is expected to work with one symbol
swap (`libc.so.6` -> `libc.dylib`); the spec is otherwise identical.
Windows requires a different wakeup primitive (named events) and
shared-memory backing (named file mappings) — Phase 3 deliverable.
