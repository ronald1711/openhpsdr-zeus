# OpenHPSDR Zeus — The King of SDRs

![OpenHPSDR Zeus](docs/pics/zeus1.webp)

A browser-based SDR console for the **Hermes Lite 2** and other OpenHPSDR
radios. .NET 10 backend talks Protocol-1 / Protocol-2 to the radio and streams
IQ / audio / meter data to a React + WebGL frontend over WebSocket.

> Status: early but working.
>
> - **Hermes Lite 2 (Protocol-1):** RX is solid; TX is operator-verified on FM
>   and TUNE (v0.1, April 2026).
> - **ANAN G2 / G2 MkII (Protocol-2):** RX verified on OrionMkII / fw 2.7b41
>   across 80m–10m. TX wired for TUNE and MOX — on-air carrier verified clean
>   via an external KiwiSDR. PureSignal converging on G2 MkII. 160m not yet wired.
> - **ANAN-100D / Angelia (Protocol-2):** RX verified; S-ATT and PRE wired to radio.
> - Other Protocol-1 radios (older ANAN, Hermes, etc.) are not yet supported.
>
> **Important:** OpenHPSDR Zeus has only been tested on the **Hermes Lite 2**
> and the **ANAN G2 / G2 MkII** to date. If you have another OpenHPSDR board
> and can help bring it up, a PR would be lovely.

## About the name

**Zeus** — king of the gods. It doesn't really get more regal than that. The
name is also a nod to [Thetis](https://github.com/TAPR/OpenHPSDR-Thetis), the
long-running project a lot of the DSP heritage traces back to.

## What's in the box

- **WebGL panadapter + waterfall** with zoom, click-to-tune, drag-pan gestures
- **DSP panel**: NB, NR (NR1 / NR2 / NR4), ANF, SNB, NBP — NR2 (EMNR) at Thetis parity (Method, Trained, Post-Process), all driven by WDSP under the hood
- **Bands / modes / bandwidth / AGC / S-ATT step attenuator / PRE preamp / drive / mic gain**
- **TX**: PTT, TUNE, mic uplink, TX stage meters, SWR-trip and TX-timeout
  protection
- **PureSignal** (Protocol-2): four-patch convergence with AutoAttenuate loop
- **TX Audio Tools**: 10-band CFC for voice shaping
- **S-meter** (live + demo), RX meter frame streaming
- **Leaflet satellite map** with terminator and QRZ grid-square / beam heading
  — to interact with the map (pan / zoom), **press and hold the `M` key**.
  The experience isn't ideal yet and will improve over time.
- **Radio discovery** on the LAN (Protocol-1 + Protocol-2 broadcast, in parallel)
- **Plugin system** — operators install backend / UI / audio plugins from a curated registry or by URL. See [`docs/plugins/author-guide.md`](docs/plugins/author-guide.md); registry repo at [`Kb2uka/openhpsdr-zeus-plugins`](https://github.com/Kb2uka/openhpsdr-zeus-plugins).

## Download

Grab the latest installer from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/Kb2uka/openhpsdr-zeus/releases/latest)**
— Windows x64 `.exe`, Windows on ARM (Snapdragon / Surface Pro X) `.exe`, macOS `.dmg`, Linux `.tar.gz`. Full install detail (PWA path,
macOS Gatekeeper xattr step, first-run WDSP wisdom wait) is on the wiki's
[Installation](https://github.com/Kb2uka/openhpsdr-zeus/wiki/Installation)
page.

### macOS users — read this before launching

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: After installing on macOS, run this in Terminal before opening Zeus:**
>
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/Zeus.app
> ```
>
> **Without this step, macOS Gatekeeper will refuse to launch Zeus** ("Zeus.app is damaged and can't be opened" or "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"). Zeus is not yet signed by a registered Apple Developer; the command above strips the quarantine attribute so Gatekeeper allows the app to run. This is a one-time step per install.

## Building from source

See the wiki's [Developer Guide](https://github.com/Kb2uka/openhpsdr-zeus/wiki/Developer-Guide)
for prerequisites, the two-terminal dev loop, project layout, tests, and
conventions.

## Acknowledgements

OpenHPSDR Zeus stands on the shoulders of the OpenHPSDR community. Most of
what OpenHPSDR Zeus knows about Protocol-1 framing, Protocol-2 client
behaviour, WDSP init ordering, meter pipelines, and TX safety was learned by
reading the [Thetis source](https://github.com/ramdor/Thetis). OpenHPSDR Zeus
is an independent reimplementation in .NET — not a fork — but Thetis is the
authoritative reference for how an OpenHPSDR client should behave, and it
continues a GPL-governed lineage that runs from FlexRadio PowerSDR through
the OpenHPSDR (TAPR) ecosystem to Thetis itself.

OpenHPSDR Zeus gratefully acknowledges the Thetis contributors:

- **Richard Samphire** (MW0LGE)
- **Warren Pratt** (NR0V) — also author of **WDSP**, the DSP engine OpenHPSDR
  Zeus loads via P/Invoke
